          <span className="about-span">MyPath </span>is dedicated to helping
          high school students and young adults plan for the future. Money
          management is a complicated issue and you should consult a
          professional before making any decisions, but MyPath is a useful
          guide. We make it easy. You will be asked to answer a few questions
          and MyPath will create your financial profile. Your profile will let
          you view and edit your expected income and expenses. <br></br>
          To calculate your financial profile data, we take information from
          reliable resources like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and
          perform some statistical analysis. While these numbers are just
          estimates, we are constantly improving our analysis and methods, so
          they serve as a great guide to help you plan for the future.
